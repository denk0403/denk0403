## Hello! 👋
My name is Dennis, and here is what you should know about me:
- 🏫 I graduated from Northeastern University with a degree in Computer Science & Mathematics.
- 🌱 I primarily do full-stack web development, but I'm currently learning some systems programming and WebAssembly.
- 📫 You can reach me quickest by [email](mailto:denniskats43@gmail.com).
- ⚡ Fun fact: I didn't learn to snap with my fingers until I was 17.
